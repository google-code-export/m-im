v1.1.0 - Updated release by Mark

	** Application Data NOT backwards compatible with v1.0.0!!!
	Either uninstall v1.0.0 then install v1.1.0 or answer "No" if 
	your phone prompts you to keep the existing application data

	New Functionality
		
		Customisable "Resource" property for XMPP connection
		
		Added "Display Name" to connection profile
		
		Added vibrate function for supported handsets (most)
		
		Minimise Support - allows running in the background
		
		Added user-friendly titles to all screens
			- Chat with <Remote User Display Name> for ChatUI
			- Profile Name for ContactListUI, rather than JID
		
		Changed right and left click buttons in Contact List and ChatUI
		
		Added menu with disconnect and quit options, and put "minimise" 
		as right click option rather than disconnect
		
		Workaround: Added keypress options for 3,6,9 to increase volume 
		and vibrate times as rightclick isn't working. 

		Restricted port number dialog entry to numbers only

	Known Issues
		
		Need to add a method "supportsBackgroundRunning()" which returns
		true if the phone supports minimise/background running of J2ME
		applications, and false otherwise. This can then be used to
		determine whether minimise or another function is assigned
		to the right screen key on the UI

v1.0.0 - Initial Release uploaded to googlecode by chunlinyao
	
	Known Issues
		
		A few missing titles, and some UI Strings are hardcoded
		
		On S60, right joypad does not increase volume or vibrate time
		on the slider control, but left click DOES decrease it!
		
		When contacts go offline, their status icon changes to red
		(busy), rather than the grey cross (offline). This means it's
		hard to distinguish if someone has gone to DND or offline
		
		"Error message" dialogue doesn't always dissappear properly
